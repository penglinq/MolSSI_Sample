# MolSSI_Sample
Code sample for MolSSI Seed Fellowship application (2021 B)

bcor.py: a sample code Linqing developed from the DMET (density matrix embedding theory) library with correlated bath. This is used to parametrize embedding bases to perform gradient-based optimzization.

APT_Interfacial_Chemistry.py: Python software for Atom Probe Tomography to process the raw outupt data from the instrument. Calculate the concentration of one element on the surface of a precipitate in a APT sample. Vualize this interfacial chemistry in 3D using Mayavi.
